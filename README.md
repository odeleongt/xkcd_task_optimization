Task optimization chart
=======================

Automated task optimization time chart based on http://xkcd.com/1205/. This R project prepares a chart similar to the one depicted in the xkcd webcomic:


Additional features
-------------------

It is expected that you will be able to specify additional characteristics for the automated chart, such as:

- Alternative time span
- Number of people who perform the task
- Daily commitment to optimization (chart should show how long the optimiation would take to be completed, in work periods)


Required packages
----------------------------------------
This project requires the use of the ggplot2 package to prepare the chart, and the reshape2 package to manipulate the data. The extrafont package should be used to load the HumorSans font. The grid package is included with each base R install.
